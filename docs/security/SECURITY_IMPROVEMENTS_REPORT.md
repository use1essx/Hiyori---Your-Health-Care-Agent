## üîß IMPLEMENTED SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY HEADERS** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**New Security Headers Added:**
```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; [...]
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=(), [...]
Server: Healthcare-AI-V2
X-Process-Time: [request_processing_time]
```

**Security Benefits:**
- **Clickjacking Protection:** X-Frame-Options prevents iframe embedding
- **XSS Mitigation:** Content Security Policy and X-XSS-Protection
- **MIME Sniffing Prevention:** X-Content-Type-Options blocks MIME attacks
- **Information Disclosure:** Custom server header prevents fingerprinting
- **Privacy Protection:** Referrer-Policy controls referrer information

### 2. **ENHANCED SECURITY MIDDLEWARE STACK** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Middleware Components (Applied in Order):**

1. **SecurityAuditMiddleware**
   - Detects suspicious patterns in requests
   - Logs security alerts for monitoring
   - Patterns monitored: SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal

2. **RequestSizeMiddleware**
   - Prevents DoS attacks via large requests
   - Limit: 10MB maximum request size
   - Returns 413 status for oversized requests

3. **RequestLoggingMiddleware**
   - Enhanced request/response logging
   - Includes processing time, IP, User-Agent
   - Security-focused log formatting

4. **SecurityHeadersMiddleware**
   - Applies comprehensive security headers
   - HSTS support for production HTTPS
   - Configurable security policies

5. **EnhancedCORSMiddleware**
   - Stricter CORS policies than default
   - Explicit origin allowlist
   - Controlled method and header permissions

### 3. **DATABASE SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Limited Database User Created:**
```sql
User: healthcare_app_user
Privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE only
Restrictions: No CREATE, DROP, or administrative privileges
```

**Security Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimal required permissions only

### 4. **REQUEST MONITORING & LOGGING** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Enhanced Security Logging:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-28 17:23:06",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "src.core.security_middleware",
  "message": "Request: POST /api/v1/agents/chat | Status: 200 | Time: 2.215s | IP: 172.18.0.1 | UA: curl/8.5.0...",
  "processing_time_ms": 2215,
  "client_ip": "172.18.0.1",
  "user_agent": "curl/8.5.0"
}
```

**Monitoring Features:**
- **Request Tracking:** All requests logged with timing and metadata
